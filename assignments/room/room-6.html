      <p>All that you touch</p>
        <p> And all that you see</p>
        <p> All that you taste</p>
        <p> All that you feel</p>
        <p> And all that you love</p>
        <p> And all that you hate</p>
        <p> All you distrust</p>
        <p> All that you save</p>
        <p> And all that you give</p>
        <p> And all that you deal</p>
        <p> And all that you buy beg, borrow, or steal</p>
        <p> And all you create</p>
        <p> And all you destroy</p>
        <p> And all that you do</p>
        <p> And all that you say</p>
        <p> And all that you eat</p>
        <p> And everyone you meet</p>
        <p> And all that you slight</p>
        <p> And everyone you fight</p>
        <p> And all that is now</p>
        <p> And all that is gone</p>
        <p> And all that's to come</p>
        <p> And everything under the sun is in tune</p>
        <p> But the sun is eclipsed by the moon</p>
        <p> (There is no dark side in the moon really Matter of fact it's all dark)</p></div>
