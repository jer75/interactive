        <h1>Cities</h1>
        <h2>What role does a city's relationship to nature, and its surrounding environment as a whole, play in its longevity?</h2>
        <p> José: Nature plays a vital role in cities’ survival. Even today, mid-sized cities, as well as certain parts of other larger or smaller cities, run the risk of becoming food deserts. As time goes by, a city’s commitment to sustainability will become more and more important to its survival. Ethical expansion methods will also grow to be more of an issue as cities continue to grow and become overpopulated. Those tasked with making sure cities are capable of keeping up with demand will have to become more involved with their surrounding communities. Families and entire communities have to stop getting displaced for the benefit of others. I believe that the most successful cities of the future will be those that manage to continue growing with little impact towards its immediate surroundings. </p> <br>
