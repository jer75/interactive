        <h1>Barely Functional Commmunity Garden</h1>
        <p>Simone Cutri: In the same way that Laurel was talking about the idea of gardens and community, I still feel within the
website, that there are separated gardens: a garden of graphic design, a garden of sculpture, etc. And today
in this conversation, we’re mostly from graphic design. I wonder if the website can talk about
communities…</p>
        <p> José: I think it definitely can talk about commmunities. Just by going on the webiste you can learn what concentrations within the art school more actively use the website. For example, visiting the Undergraduate tab quickly shows that undergrads can't make changes to the site but no one else really cares about the page enough to edit it. Becuase deciding not to chage a certain page or a certain style says just as much about a group as changing it does.

          I do however wish that we as undergrads could change the site. I think it create interesting dialogues as a good number of undergrads come back for graduate school and/or as professors. </p>
